Upon construction an array of networks will be added to the "networkList" array, names of each network will be added into the array. The "selectedNetwork" field will be assigned with "current\_network" from the local storage.

On initialization the setTranslation() function is called.

changeNetwork(p)

Assign the name from the parameter "p" to the "selectedNetwork" field. Then the "current\_network" from the local storage is checked with the "selectedNetwork" field, if it is different, then the "selectedNetwork" field will be checked if it's "Solana Mainnet" then a "walletAddress" variable is created and the "SOL\_w\_address" is assigned to the variable from the local storage. If there is no "walletAddress" then the "alertEmptyWalletAdress()" function is called, else variables from the local storage will be changed and variables will be removed from the storage. If it is not "Solana Mainnet" the same set of processes will be repeated with "BSC Mainnet", "Ethereum Mainnet" and "Polygon Mainnet".

dismissModal()

Closes the modal.

alertEmptyWalletAdress()

Creates an alert with header, subheader, and messages based on the fields. Also contains 3 buttons, one button for creating a wallet that redirects to the "mnemonic" page with the role of 'ok', one button to import a wallet that redirects to the "import-wallet" page with the role of 'ok' and one button to cancel and assigns the "currentNetwork" field to the "selectedNetwork".

setTranslation()

The function calls the "TranslateService" class to get text for each given parameter translated to the target language and the text will be assigned to the field that corresponds to the text.

Upon initialization, it will call the "setTranslation()" function, as well as set the "walletAddress" field to "w\_address" field from the local storage. The "coins" field will also be assigned with an empty array. The "current\_network" field from the local storage will be checked to see which mainnet it's set to and the relevant value will be assigned to the "currentTokenListToUse" field.

The token list to use to be taken from the local storage and parsed and will be assigned to the variable "tokenArray". A check will be run to check if "tokenArray" is null, if it's not, an array will be made from "tokenArray" and assigned to the field "coins".

The "allTokenList" and "allIconList" fields are assigned with empty arrays. The icon for the network is taken from the local storage, parsed and assigned to the "iconList" variable. A check will be run to check if "iconList" is null, if it's not, an array will be made from "iconList" and assigned to the field "allIconList".

If the current network is not Solana Mainnet, the "tmpAddress" variable will be created and be assigned with "w\_address" from the local storage. The "balance\_ETH" field will be assigned with the balance.

After setting "balance\_ETH" in the local storage for both the if and else case, the "balance\_ETH" field will be assigned with the same field from the local storage and the "value\_ETH" field will be assigned with the number of "balance\_ETH" multiplied with the number of "price\_ETH", and if "value\_ETH" is not a number it will be set to 0.

Then call the "removeExistingToken() and "removeExistingFavouriteToken()" functions with the "coins" field as the parameter, and set the "allTokensBSC" field in the storage with the "allTokenList" field as a string.

If an error happens, a variable "allTokens" will be assigned with the "allTokensBSC" field from the storage after being parsed, and if "allTokens" is not null, and array will be formed from "allTokens" and assigned to the "allTokenList" field.

Then try to call the api for getting the token of the given wallet address. If the length of the "coins" array in the api is more than or equal to 0, call the "tidyTokenInfo()" function with the "data.items" from the api as the parameter.
